## Concept Category
> **Who’s the next trendsetter?**

Artifact.fun is not just a meme trading platform. We recognize memes as digital artworks and use Web3 technology to ensure creators receive fair rewards. By transforming memes, which were previously only consumed on social media, into **"ownable digital assets,"** we aim to build a platform where the community drives trends and fosters creativity.

### Key Concepts

- **Discovering Web3 Meme Trendsetters**
    - A community-based voting system identifies and supports creators who lead new meme trends.
- **On-Chain Assetization of Memes**
    - Selected memes are minted as NFTs via AI-powered automation, ensuring their permanence on the blockchain.
- **Community-Driven Value Creation**
    - The value of memes is determined by the community. A ranking and voting system selects the most influential memes, rewarding participation.
- **NFTs for Rarity and Ownership**
    - Memes are not just shared but transformed into **limited edition digital artworks** that can be auctioned and traded.

## Project Description

Artifact.fun is a Web3-based meme trendsetter platform that discovers creative meme creators and ensures their works receive proper recognition. Users participate in on-chain voting to select the best memes, and AI agents **automatically mint them as NFTs** and promote them. Additionally, an **NFT auction system** will be implemented to maximize the economic value of memes and reward community members for their participation.

## Problem

**1️⃣ Lack of Fair Compensation for Meme Creators**
- On traditional social media, popular memes gain exposure but do not generate direct revenue for their creators.
- There is a need to establish a system where meme creators are fairly rewarded.

**2️⃣ Unauthorized Use & Copyright Issues**
- Memes are widely shared online, often without crediting the original creator.
- A transparent ownership system using blockchain is needed to protect original works.

**3️⃣ Lack of Economic Value Recognition for Memes**
- Memes are an integral part of internet culture, yet they are rarely treated as valuable digital assets.
- By **converting memes into NFTs**, we can introduce a new **economic model** where meme ownership holds real-world value.

## Solution

**✅ On-Chain Voting System**
- The community directly participates in selecting the most popular memes through blockchain-based voting.
- Voting results are **immutably recorded on-chain**, ensuring transparency.

**✅ AI-Powered NFT Minting & Promotion**
- Selected memes are automatically **minted as NFTs** through AI agents.
- Automated posting to Twitter and other social platforms helps **spread trends organically**.

**✅ Meme Creator Compensation System**
- NFT minting ensures that creators **retain ownership** of their works.
- Auction-based sales **generate revenue**, with **royalties granted on each resale**.

**✅ NFT Auction System *(Planned Feature)***
- Meme NFTs will be **sold exclusively through auctions**, ensuring scarcity and maintaining value.

**✅ Reward System for Voters & Participants**
- Users who vote on meme rankings **earn on-chain points** that can be redeemed within the platform.
- Accumulated points allow users to **mint their own ranking NFTs**, enhancing their status in the community.
